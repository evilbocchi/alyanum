**AlyaNum** is the ultimate big number library for Roblox incremental games, perfect for both small and large-scale projects!

This library is a high-performance fork of [OmegaNum](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/11646892509/OmegaNum-Readable) by FoundForces and [Naruyoko](https://github.com/Naruyoko), completely rewritten for speed, clarity, and maintainability. AlyaNum stands out with its extraordinary limit: numbers up to 10^^^^^10 (heptation), a value so large it's virtually unreachable in any Roblox game.

Despite this massive range, AlyaNum is faster than other libraries like [EternityNum](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/12144172446/EternityNum-2) and [InfiniteMath](https://github.com/KdudeDev/InfiniteMath), giving you both performance and power.

If you want even more speed and don't need such a high limit, check out my other library, [SerikaNum](https://github.com/evilbocchi/serikanum), which offers a smaller cap of 10^(2^1024) but can outperform AlyaNum by 4â€“20x in most cases.
