Alisa Mikhailovna "Alya" Kujou's go-to big number library for small and large-scale incremental games! 

AlyaNum is a fork of [OmegaNum](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/11646892509/OmegaNum-Readable) by FoundForces and [Naruyoko](https://github.com/Naruyoko),
rewriting some of its unoptimized code to increase performance while what makes it special - its limit.

This number library goes up to 10^^^^^10, which to say the least, is pretty much impossible to reach by any Roblox game.
Yet, it still performs faster than other number libraries such as [EternityNum](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/12144172446/EternityNum-2) and
[InfiniteMath](https://github.com/KdudeDev/InfiniteMath) while having a higher limit!

If you really, really care about performance and don't need such a high limit, consider checking out my other number library, 
[SerikaNum](https://github.com/evilbocchi/serikanum). It has a smaller limit of 10^(2^1024) but generally outperforms it ~4-20x.
